## Akshith Ambekar

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>My name is Akshith and I'm an undergraduate student studying computer science at George Mason University. I'm currently conducting research under Professor Zoran Duric, developing a dual digital twin system for a robotic factory setting. This summer, I'm working at Allwyn Corporation on a client-facing project for Amtrak.

<p>I'm open to work! Feel free to reach out, or check out my projects and my website.
